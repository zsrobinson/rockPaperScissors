# Rock Paper Scissors

This is a little game I made around December 2020 / January 2021. I wouldn't say it's any fun playing, but it's a cool demo and shows my progress in both JavaScript and CSS compared to the trivia game I recently made from March to June 2021. I still figured I would show it here nonetheless.
